## Description

Assignment number 4 for edX Front-End Web Development Bootcamp. I was tasked with creating code for analyzing the financial records of a company.

This involves writing JavaScript code that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

- The total number of months included in the dataset.
- The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.
- The average of the **changes** in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
- The greatest increase in Profit/Losses (date and amount) over the entire period.
- The greatest decrease in Profit/Losses (date and amount) over the entire period.
